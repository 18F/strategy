#### Strategy Chapter
# Charter
____________
Everyone at 18F is a strategist. It’s in our motto: delivery is the strategy. Each of us has subject matter expertise and a unique perspective on how to apply that knowledge to each project we take on. How we apply that expertise and what we should ultimately deliver, though, isn’t always clear — it can get lost in a fog of bureaucracy, history, approvals, and politics.

**The Strategy chapter can help when the path forward is unclear.**

We create well-defined environments for delivery where they don’t exist. Our primary focus is to shape the way 18F and our partners approach situations that demand carefully managed responses. We ensure that strategy is embedded throughout product development, and that every member of 18F has confidence in the strategic work they do.

To fulfill our mission, we draw on all the tools at our disposal — workshops, discovery engagements, stakeholder management, mission and vision setting, organization design, agile coaching, DevOps, and executive advising, to name just a few. Our diverse experience helps us consider all the facets of a problem in order to develop an appropriate solution.

The folks on our team hail from varied backgrounds — law, engineering, visual design, user experience, service design, systems thinking, data science, acquisitions, policy, DevOps, research, facilitation, and product management among them. While we’re not united by a common skillset, we all share a deep passion for solving the complex, systemic challenges that prevent our partner agencies from reaching their goals.

Members of our chapter commit to being organizers, facilitators, and navigators of uncertainty as we work together to transform the way our government serves the public.

## How we can help
Every project faces financial, bureaucratic, and organizational obstacles. As Strategists, we help each business unit navigate these challenges and remain focused on their service and mission.

#### Custom Partner Solutions
We help sharpen fuzzy ideas and focus engagements. Whether we’re leading a discovery sprint or conducting field research, we help turn vague policy and stakeholder ideas into concrete priorities for product development. We strive to minimize risk in the product development process.

#### Transformation
Our partners face a range of challenges that hamper their ability to serve the public. In response, we counsel stakeholders across a given organization, helping them hone their vision, examine their culture, discover new talent, and experiment with novel solutions. We coordinate across each agency to ensure their teams, services, and policies are aligned for success. In short, we create the space for new products and practices to thrive.

#### Learn
We actively share 18F’s knowledge and practices with our partner agencies, helping them develop new ways of operating. We facilitate workshops that bring new concepts, methods, and tools to the work our partners already have underway. We coach everyone from executives to program managers in topics that range from user-centered design and research methodologies to DevOps, system architecture, and agile practices.

#### Products & Platforms
We’re available for 18F product teams that feel the need for outside perspective, vetting, troubleshooting, and brainstorming. We have experience developing innovative models for financing new products, transitioning custom products into platform opportunities, iterating customer acquisition strategies, and outlining the path to product maturity.

#### Acquisitions
In each engagement, we help agencies develop product strategy that’s modular and suited for agile acquisition. During the discovery and product-strategy scoping phases of the RFP ghostwriting process, we advise acquisition authorities. Our team encourages adherence to user-centered design and agile software methodologies while exposing proper product tradeoff decisions. We assess projects in-flight to identify risks, propose alternatives, and develop shared visions with vendors and agency partners.

#### Internal Projects
The moment we stray from the guidance we share with our partners is the moment 18F loses its purpose. The Strategy Chapter works on internal projects aimed at preserving and delivering on our values of continuous improvement, inclusive culture, and public service. We help 18F practice what we preach.
