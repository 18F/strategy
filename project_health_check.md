#### Strategy Chapter

# Project Health Check

This document lays out some ideas around how the Strategy chapter could help provide a “health check” service for project teams. It stems from a conversation between Gail and Ed.

Here I’ll lay out some notes about the idea. Jump to the bottom for some recommendations if we wanted to move forward. You can skim the big text for just a high-level.

There has been discussion of adopting a periodic health-check model within the Agile guild. Alan Atlas and Bret Mogilefsky seem to have led this discussion...

Here is the trello card for the idea. Excerpt:

* "Many teams are saying they are having trouble with testing... Shall we hold some training on TDD, or ask the one team that says it's going great to present on their techniques?"
* "Many teams say they don't have enough design skills available in the team... Can we get this problem addressed via aggressive design focus in the hiring pipeline for the next quarter?"
* "These two teams are unhappy and have a lot of dependencies on each other... Should we suggest that they re-form to eliminate the dependency?"
* "Team Armadillo is continuing to have problems making their rituals fun... Can we suggest some tasty cupcakes that might help?"
* "Since last quarter, we held three kanban trainings... Have teams adopted that technique in their normal practice?"

Spotify runs squad health checkups on a (roughly) quarterly basis. It is focused on progress of persistent teams over time and identifying trends across those teams.

The Agile Guild referred to the [Spotify squad health checkup](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/). This is a facilitated process with a workshop as the core activity. Teams identify their current perspective along a variety of predefined categories. The diagram below gives a sense of the depth of subjective data that’s produced and how it helps them see patterns across squads.

18F doesn’t have the same orderly org structure that makes the Spotify model directly applicable. We’d need to tailor an approach that would be helpful for ourselves.

Alan made the point in the Agile Guild discussion that stable, persistent teams would be a prerequisite. This condition applies for a variety of existing project teams such as FEC. There are many other projects that don’t have persistent teams. At Spotify, where teams are focused on clearly define components for long periods of time, this model fits well.

In the context of 18F, we would need to define how we define health. 

Healthy relative to what? 

* 18F ideals?
* Initial KPIs?
* The same team at a previous state
* Other teams?

Some factors

* We likely will need different factors based on the type of project (CPS project vs Platform)
* External Assessment (assessment team reviews project team work) vs. Facilitated Self-assessment (facilitation team helps project team assess themselves)
* Periodic health checks (to track health over time) vs. As Needed (to determine current health) 
* The tone is important to get right.

Some things to evaluate

* Are we doing the right work?
* Are we doing the right work the wrong way?
* Do we have what we need?
* Effectiveness in battling the bureaucracy
* Value we’re delivering
* Impact we’re making
* Best use of talent from 18F’s perspective
* Alignment with 18F ideals/aspirations
* Relationship to stakeholders

I don’t think we need to figure this all out now. If we think in lean terms, we can just “advertise” the offering with a general description and figure it out when someone wants to buy it. 

If we wanted to pursue this as an offering, it would make sense to treat it like an experiment and seek to validate it along the way.

Recommendation: 
* Hold a one-hour meeting with a small group of people to hash out a description only. 
* Market the offering to BUs however we do that.
* When we have a “buyer”, convene a small team to figure out how to execute.
* Run first assessment with BU project team
* Conduct retro on process as and make changes for next assessment.
* It would be good to have at least one person who sticks with this productized service* through several assessments to iterate on it well. 

*It's worth noting that this feels like a product offering by the Strategy chapter, rather than a role Strategy chapter members would play on project teams. I'm not advocating that this chapter to start offering products. I’m just exploring the idea based on a conversation Gail and I had. My general inclination is for chapters to be light skill-similar groups who integrate with project teams.
